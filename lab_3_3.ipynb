        "1.  **Input Validation:** The function starts with robust input validation: `if not isinstance(kwh, int) or kwh < 0: return \"Input must be a non-negative integer.\"`. This directly addresses the lack of specific input handling in the vague version and ensures that the calculation proceeds only with valid non-negative integer inputs for kWh consumption.\n",

        "2.  **Fixed Monthly Service Fee:** It includes a `fixed_fee = 10.00`, which is added to the calculation regardless of consumption. This addresses the limitation of the vague code which only considered a variable charge based on consumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Tiered Rate Structure:** The code implements a tiered rate system. It defines `rate_tier_1` for the first 100 kWh and `rate_tier_2` for consumption above 100 kWh. It then calculates the `consumption_tier_1` using `min(kwh, tier_1_limit)` and `consumption_tier_2` using `max(0, kwh - tier_1_limit)`. This logic accurately splits the total kWh into the respective tiers, addressing the limitation of the vague code which used a single, fixed rate. The charges for each tier (`charge_tier_1` and `charge_tier_2`) are calculated based on these consumption amounts and their respective rates.\n",
        "\n",

This tax amount is then added to the subtotal to get the `total_bill`. This adds a crucial component missing entirely from the vague version, making the calculation more realistic.\n",

The vague version was a gross oversimplification.\n",

It significantly expands upon the `calculate_power_bill_refined` function by introducing time-of-use rates, seasonal variations, different customer types with unique rate structures, credits, and a detailed output format.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how it addresses the limitations of the refined version and incorporates the new complexities:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Multiple Inputs for Consumption:** Instead of a single total consumption input (`kwh`), it takes `consumption_day` and `consumption_night` as separate non-negative float inputs. This is necessary to implement time-of-use billing, where peak and off-peak consumption are billed at different rates. The refined version could not handle this distinction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Customer Type Differentiation:** The function accepts a `customer_type` string ('residential', 'commercial', 'industrial') and uses it to apply different fixed charges and consumption rate structures. The refined version only handled a single implied customer type with one fixed fee and one tiered rate structure. This function uses a dictionary `fixed_charges` to easily look up the correct fixed fee and then branches logic based on the `customer_type` to apply the correct consumption rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Seasonal Rate Variation:** For 'residential' customers, the function checks the `is_winter_month` boolean input to apply different peak and off-peak rates during winter vs. non-winter months, as specified in the prompt. The refined version had no concept of seasonal variations in rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Complex Tiered Time-of-Use Rates:** It implements distinct tiered rate structures for peak and off-peak consumption, varying by customer type and season (for residential). This is a significant step up from the single, simple tiered rate structure of the refined version. The code uses `min` and `max` functions to correctly allocate consumption within each tier for both peak and off-peak usage across different customer types.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Credits/Adjustments:** The function includes logic to apply a specific renewable energy credit (`credits = 5.00`) for residential customers during non-winter months if their total consumption is below 300 kWh. This demonstrates handling specific conditions for applying adjustments, which was not present in the refined version.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Detailed Output Dictionary:** Instead of just returning a single rounded total bill amount, the function returns a dictionary (`bill_details`) containing a breakdown of all charges: fixed charge, peak charge, off-peak charge, subtotal (before credits), credits, tax amount, and the total bill. All monetary values in the dictionary are rounded to two decimal places as required. This provides a much more transparent and detailed bill summary, addressing the limitation of the refined version's simple scalar output.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  **Input Validation (Enhanced):** It performs validation on all four inputs (`consumption_day`, `consumption_night`, `customer_type`, `is_winter_month`), checking for non-negative numbers, valid customer types, and boolean type. This is more comprehensive than the refined version's check only for non-negative integers for a single input.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  **Tax Calculation (Applied to Subtotal After Credits):** The tax is correctly calculated as 6.5% of the subtotal *after* applying the renewable energy credit, as specified in the prompt.\n",

        "In summary, `calculate_power_bill_complex` successfully translates a highly detailed and complex set of billing rules into code.

        "This function, `convert_temperature_advanced`, represents the most sophisticated and versatile solution generated, directly addressing the limitations of both the vague and refined versions by implementing the complex requirements of the further refined prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how it addresses the previous shortcomings and incorporates the new complexities:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Multiple Unit Support:** Unlike the previous versions which were limited to a single or implicit conversion, this function takes `from_unit` and `to_unit` as explicit inputs and includes logic to handle conversions between any combination of 'C', 'F', and 'K'. This is a major improvement in flexibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Comprehensive Conversion Logic:** It correctly implements the necessary formulas for all six possible conversion pairs between C, F, and K. The intermediate step of converting to Celsius first simplifies the logic flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Enhanced Input Validation:** It includes more comprehensive input validation than the refined version. It not only checks if `temp_value` is a number but also validates that both `from_unit` and `to_unit` are among the valid 'C', 'F', or 'K' strings. This makes the function much more robust to invalid inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Detailed and Formatted Output:** It returns a formatted string that includes the converted temperature rounded to two decimal places *and* the target unit (e.g., \"77.00 F\"). This provides a clear and unambiguous output, a significant enhancement over the simple numeric output of the previous versions. It also handles the case where `from_unit` and `to_unit` are the same, returning the original value formatted.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Clear Error Messages:** The error messages are more specific, indicating whether the problem is with the temperature value or an invalid unit, which aids in debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Comparison of Code Quality Across Prompt Specificities:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Vague Prompt:** Produced the lowest quality code. It was hardcoded for a single implicit conversion (C to F), lacked flexibility, had no input validation, and provided a basic, potentially ambiguous output. The AI made assumptions due to the lack of detail.\n",
        "*   **Refined Prompt:** Produced significantly better code quality.
